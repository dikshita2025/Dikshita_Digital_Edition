  "summary": "i was honestly just bored today. and guess what — when i came home, the tv was turned to face the wall. yep, my dad is now on a mission to make our home more digital-free. apparently, it’s because my brother was overusing the tv — completely hooked on gaming. it’s kinda funny, but also weirdly quiet without the tv. anyway, i listened to some telugu music to lift the mood. also, i ordered five books from amazon: python core programming, deep learning and neural networks, machine learning, dsa, and introduction to optimization. feeling a bit productive about that. after dinner, i went for a nice walk. it helped clear my head a bit. good night!"
