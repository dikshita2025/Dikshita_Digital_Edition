    "summary": "hey, today was a bit emotional. semester 2 gpa came out — i got around 3.4. honestly, the second semester was really tough. there were just too many courses, and i couldn’t keep up the way i wanted to. i didn’t do well, and i’m feeling a bit down about it. i know i could’ve done better… and i regret not pushing myself harder. but it’s okay. i’m trying to accept it and move on. next semester is my chance to bounce back. there’s a small temple in our apartment that i visit every day. it’s become a peaceful routine — just standing there, praying, and asking god to give me the strength to rise and grind again. it helps me feel centered. oh, and some news — dinesh sir is planning to take the top 15 students to iisc bangalore after sem 3. i really, really hope i make it. that would mean so much. fingers crossed."
