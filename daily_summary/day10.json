    "summary": "today felt pretty balanced. i started off with a quiet morning — just me, a cup of coffee, and some thinking. i didn’t rush into anything, which felt really nice. later, i spent some time reviewing dsa basics. finally made a proper schedule to include dsa into my daily routine — feels good to have a plan. i also revised a bit of my project and added some polish to the work i submitted. driving class went well too — getting smoother day by day. in the evening, i went on a walk and just listened to music, letting my mind breathe. no major events, but it felt like the kind of day that slowly puts you back on track. good night!"
